# diamonds-list
Diamond's List is a way to connect people with service needs to returning citizens that can assist them. 

The goals are 1) to provide affordable assistance to communities and organizations in need, and 2) to help returning citizens get to work and become self-sufficient.

Available services include repairs (e.g., home, auto), maintenance (e.g., cleaning, landscaping) or freelance projects (e.g., digital services, advocacy speakers).
